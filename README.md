**Flight Finder**

Amid the pandemic still racing through the world in early 2021, I've found myself missing one of the simple pleasures in life I could afford to partake in pre-COVID : traveling. 

The goal of this project is to find the optimal (in this case, cheapest) common flight destination given two origins. 
Say you work in ZÃ¼rich, and want to plan a trip with a friend who lives in Madrid: how can you find the cheapest destination in the South of France where you both can fly to? 
A lot of the work behind such a process usually involves iterative requests and comparisons, so why not build an app that automatically takes care of that given the parameters (ie. dates, origins, possible destinations..) provided by the web app user and serves for ex the top 3 cheapest options?
